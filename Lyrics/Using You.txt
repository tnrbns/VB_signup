"Using You" by Mars Argo
What's with these homies who be dissin' my boy?
Do they know I'm aggravated with the negativity and the noise?
They tell me "find a wealthy man," but they don't seem too happy

I was afraid to put myself on the line for a boy
Until he put me in my place and showed me how to enjoy myself
I think I need your help, I think she's coming back

Chorus:
You're the only one who's making me come
To my sinful senses
I'll never love anyone the same
I'll never feel ashamed of using you for pleasure

Am I naive to think that he could be the love of my life?
There is a voice inside my head that's tellin' me that it's right
I never thought I'd tell him how scared I am of losing him

[Repeat Chorus]

Someday we'll both be older
I wonder if we'll be together looking back on the past
But I don't care if I don't live to see another day
I love you in the worst way

I love you and I hate you and I'm losing my mind
And you tell me all the time that this will pass and that I'm gonna be fine
We're such a mess together, you make me lose my temper

[Repeat Chorus]
Of using you for pleasure
Of using you for pleasure
